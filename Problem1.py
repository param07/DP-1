## Problem1 (https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)

# https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/

# Method1: Recursion
# m ----- no: of coins
# n ----- amount
# Time Complexity : O(2^(m + n)) -- At every step, we have two choice to make and the max level or the max depth of the tree is m+n
# Space Complexity : O(1) space. But if we consider auxiliary space of the recursion stack, it would be O(m + n)
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : TLE
# Any problem you faced while coding this : No


# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach in three sentences only
# Since greedy does not give us a valid result. So we try to be exhaustive in our search and explore all possible paths that would
# make our amount = 0 and we take the minimum number of coins at each step that would make our amount left = 0. Since our problem is
# based on problem -> subproblem -> subproblem -> subproblem -> subproblem, so we use recursion to solve. Since time complexity is 
# very high, it gives us TLE for higher values, but it would gives us correct result

# of the dp matrix would always be 0 as it would be base case of our recursion where we need to return min number of coins required to 
# make the amount of 0. Here we use first row as dummy, storing min coins of denomination [0] required to make amount of 1,2,..... amount
# As these are invalid cases, so we store infinity there. Then we apply operation on our dp array handling two main cases. When 
# denomination of coin > current amount, then our min coins would always come from the above row that case 0 when we dont choose that coin.
# if denomination of coin <= current amount, then we the min(above row, 1 + min coins we got from denomination no. of steps back)
